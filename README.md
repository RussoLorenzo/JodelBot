# JodelBot
JodelBot - A proof-of-concept of an upvoting bot for Jodel App.

It simply get 70 post from Jodel API, then after parsing them (Response are in JSON) it upvotes every post. 
## TODO:
- Maybe add up vote also to comments.
- Create a @jodelbot which can be called in jodel posts (Ex: @Jodelbot What will be the weather in Arcavacata today?)
- Clean the code
- Better variables input

API Documentation will come soon, or maybe never. ðŸ¤”
